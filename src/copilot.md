# Best practices for Github Copilot

## Customizing GitHub Copilot

To customize GitHub Copilot, you can use the `custom-instructions.md` file in your repository. This file allows you to define specific behaviors and preferences for Copilot's suggestions. Key steps include:

1. **Create the File**: Add a `custom-instructions.md` file to your repository's root directory.
2. **Define Preferences**: Specify rules, coding styles, or other instructions to tailor Copilot's responses.
3. **Apply Changes**: Save the file and ensure it is accessible to Copilot during its operation.

1. **Server Setup**: Ensure your MCP server is properly configured to handle requests from GitHub Copilot.
2. **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms to validate user access.
3. **Integration**: Connect the MCP server with your development environment to enable seamless communication.
4. **Testing**: Verify the server's functionality by running tests to ensure compatibility and performance.
